# Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project, I compare two different types of posts made on Hacker News, a site extremely popular in technology and startup circles. Posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. I am specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question and submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

I'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
