Posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. I am specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either <code>Ask HN</code> or <code>Show HN</code>. Users submit <code>Ask HN</code> posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question and submit <code>Show HN</code> posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.</p>\n",
    "<p>I'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Do <code>Ask HN</code> or <code>Show HN</code> receive more comments on average?</li>\n",
    "<li>Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?</li>\n",

    "<p>It should be noted that the data set I'm working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts/data#\">Here</a> is the link to the full untouched dataset.</p>\n"
